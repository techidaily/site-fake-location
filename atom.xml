You will find the “Location Services” feature, click on it, and see the “Share My Location” feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-share-my-location.jpg"                      alt="enable share my location"                ></p><p>Toggle on the option to enable it. Once the feature is enabled, your friends will see your location, and you can see theirs.</p><p>For Android users, go to “Settings” &gt; “Additional settings” &gt; “Privacy” &gt; “Location”, and choose the location mode to enable it.</p><h3 id="Tip-6-Restart-the-Oppo-F23-5G-or-Android-Phones"><a href="#Tip-6-Restart-the-Oppo-F23-5G-or-Android-Phones" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: Restart the Oppo F23 5G  or Android Phones"></a>Tip 6: Restart the Oppo F23 5G  or Android Phones</h3><p>The next tip to use when Find My Friends says location not available is restarting your phone. For most devices, the method is common. But for Oppo F23 5G  X and 11, the steps are slightly different. For other Oppo F23 5G  models, press the Power button and wait until the slider appears. For Oppo F23 5G  X and 11&#x2F;12&#x2F;13&#x2F;14, you’ll have to hold the Volume button and the Power button together to make the slider appear on the screen.</p><p>![restart Oppo F23 5G ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/restart-Oppo" >https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/restart-Oppo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> F23 5G .jpg)</p><p>Drag the Power slider to the right side and wait for the Oppo F23 5G device to shut down.

Make sure that you also clear the cache memory before opening the app again. It might fix the problem entirely.</p><h2 id="Extension-Can-I-send-the-fake-location-by-Find-Friends-to-others"><a href="#Extension-Can-I-send-the-fake-location-by-Find-Friends-to-others" class="headerlink" title="Extension: Can I send the fake location by Find Friends to others?"></a>Extension: Can I send the fake location by Find Friends to others?</h2><p>With Dr. Fone - Virtual Location software, you will be able to share <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-fake-location-on-find-my-friends.html" >a fake or any location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you want with your friends and family.

It is especially important for large companies engaging in food delivery, gaming, social media, financial services, etc.</p><p>Here are some reasons why your company should be wary of GPS spoofing.</p><p><strong>Food Delivery</strong></p><p>Couriers who use GPS spoofing can trick food delivery apps into allowing them to accept orders they otherwise would not have access to. They may also gain an unfair advantage to gain priority in order queues and report longer rides to earn more from the platform. In addition, a more egregious issue is couriers charging for deliveries that weren’t made.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/detect-fake-gps-location-03.jpg"                      alt="location spoofing on food delivery driver apps"                ></p><p><strong>Gaming</strong></p><p>Using GPS spoofing in MMORPGs enables gamers to take advantage of faking their position without moving into the comforts of their own home. This can lead to more in-game rewards that are otherwise difficult to achieve without GPS spoofing.</p><p>Location spoofing also allows cheaters to use hundreds of mobile devices to collude and share in-game information to scam other players.</p><p><strong>Social Media</strong></p><p>Having a fake GPS on dating apps allows users to unlock more users on their profile to match with in other places. It can be dangerous if scammers or fraudsters use fake GPS to trick people into concealing their actual location.</p><p><strong>Financial Services</strong></p><p>Most financial institutions across the globe use location data to verify users to prevent fraud. Having inaccurate data is a major security beach, especially when handling financial service apps on the internet.</p><p>There are various ways to protect yourself from being on the other end of a fake GPS location. You can easily use specialized apps, including <a class="link"   href="https://apkpure.com/mock-location-root-detector/com.check.mock" >mock location detection APKs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you’re on Android.

You can cross reference from GPS, Wi-Fi, and cell tower triangulation to analyze accurate GPS.</li><li>Analyze abnormal patterns in location data presented to you from sudden jumps in location or having unrealistic speeds during movement.</li><li>Verify the accuracy of GPS by comparing location data to known landmarks, including buildings, bridges, or roads.</li><li>Using a dedicated GPS simulator and comparing results to expected from provided data.</li><li>Have a security measure to detect GPS spoofing apps installed on a user’s smartphone.</li></ul><p>While the methods to detect GPS locations are presented above, it’s important to remember that detecting fake GPS locations is difficult and requires you to combine different methods. You can easily detect mock locations on Android, but the methods available if you’re on a different device will vary depending on the resources at your disposal.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Faking your GPS is easy nowadays.

You are now ready to perform techno-wizardry, relocate to another place, or even simulate movement between two points easily! Here’s how:</p><p><strong>Teleporting To Another Location</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Click the crosshairs icon at the top right to activate Teleport Mode</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Start typing your destination location and click Go</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="drfone virtual location teleport"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You will get a popup to confirm.

Wonderful idea! Here’s how to use Dr.Fone Virtual Location spoofer Oppo A58 4G app to simulate movement such as walking the streets and catching more Pokémon:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> In the Virtual Location interface, click the middle icon at the top right (which looks like inverted S) to symbolize movement simulation between two points.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Type your destination and click Go.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> A popup shows the distance of the place from your current location (spoofed).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png"                      alt="drfone virtual location two point simulation"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Dr.Fone Virtual Location allows you to choose the simulation speed – you can select walking, cycling and a four-wheeler to simulate those speeds. Click Move Here.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> In a new popup, choose if you want to route to repeat and select the number of times. Click Match to start.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png"                      alt="drfone virtual location two point simulation"                ></p><p>You should now see your location dot moving along your chosen route at the speed you selected. Open Pokémon Go and start catching!</p><p><strong>Simulating Movement Between Multiple Points</strong></p><p>Similarly, you can simulate between multiple points to play elaborate pranks on your friends and family. If you simply spoof your location to another point as shown previously, they might not believe it. But, if you show movement from one location to another, they can’t deny that, can they? This movement simulation also helps with games such as Pokémon GO.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Click the icon at the top right (looks like italicized N)</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Start clicking the points you want to simulate movement from and through. NOTE: Simulate movements as would happen in real life otherwise game algorithms will catch up and you are liable to get banned for cheating.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png"                      alt="drfone virtual location multi point simulation"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Distance gets re-calculated after each selection.

Restarting and Closing the Software"></a>2. Restarting and Closing the Software</h3><p>When all of the aforementioned options fail, a decent option is to close the software and restart it after a few minutes. This is because the software frequently encounters an error, which is resolved when you close the software, making this a viable choice. We would also advise you to go to the Task Manager after closing the software and End Task it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-2.jpg"                      alt="restart the software"                ></p><h3 id="3-3uTools-reinstallation"><a href="#3-3uTools-reinstallation" class="headerlink" title="3. 3uTools reinstallation"></a>3. 3uTools reinstallation</h3><p>The most common cause of any software not working is poor installation. Some crucial files or components of the software are left behind as a result of faulty installation. As a result, reinstallation or the usage of a different location spoofing program is the only choice remaining.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-3.jpg"                      alt="reinstall 3utools"                ></p><h3 id="4-Restarting-Your-Computer"><a href="#4-Restarting-Your-Computer" class="headerlink" title="4.

If your virtual location feature stops working, simply close the app and restart your computer. This would delete the software from the Random access memory, as well as any bugs or errors that were preventing it from working.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-4.jpg"                      alt="restart computer"                ></p><h3 id="5-Verifying-the-network-connection-and-that-the-phone-is-unlocked"><a href="#5-Verifying-the-network-connection-and-that-the-phone-is-unlocked" class="headerlink" title="5. Verifying the network connection and that the phone is unlocked"></a>5. Verifying the network connection and that the phone is unlocked</h3><p>When you encounter a ‘not working’ problem when using the 3uTools software, the first thing you should do is check to ensure that your internet is operational and that there are no interruptions in your connections. You can resolve this by troubleshooting your internet and ensuring that its wire is correctly hooked in, as well as ensuring that your phone is already unlocked.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-5.jpg"                      alt="verify the netwrok connection"                ></p><h3 id="6-Checking-that-all-dependent-components-have-been-downloaded"><a href="#6-Checking-that-all-dependent-components-have-been-downloaded" class="headerlink" title="6.

This app tracks your GPS location and displays it to all the selected members in a circle. When the airplane mode on your device is enabled, the network will be disconnected, and thus Life360 will not be able to update your location to the members in the circle. Therefore, during <strong>airplane mode, Life360</strong> will not update your site.</p><h2 id="Wrap-it-up"><a href="#Wrap-it-up" class="headerlink" title="Wrap it up"></a>Wrap it up</h2><p>So, it can be concluded that Airplane Mode disconnects you from the cellular network and Wi-Fi. Therefore, to stop getting traced, you need to disable your location services along with the airplane mode.

Then, launch the app and select the “Virtual Location” option from the toolkit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The next step is to set up the phone’s connection. Connect your Oppo A1 5G  and click on the “Get Started” button. Now, detect your current virtual location by clicking on the “Current Virtual Location” icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png"                      alt="detect actual location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now go to the search box and type the location you want to switch to. Once the location gets detected, click on the “Move Here” option, and the location of your Oppo A1 5G  or Android phone will change to the one you specified.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="move to virtual location"                ></p><p>As you can see, when you have Dr.Fone - Virtual Location software, you can share any location with just one click.

Is there a way to check if someone has stopped sharing their location with you on their Oppo A1 5G ?</strong></p><p>If someone stops sharing their location with you on their Oppo A1 5G , you will see “Location Not Available” next to their name in the Find My app or Messages app. You can check the status of location sharing by tapping their name in the Find My app.</p><p><strong>2. Can I track a stolen Oppo A1 5G  if it is turned off?</strong></p><p>You may still be able to track a stolen Oppo A1 5G  if it is turned off using the Find My app or iCloud website. However, this depends on several factors, such as whether the Oppo A1 5G device is connected to a Wi-Fi or cellular network, and whether the person who stole the Oppo A1 5G device has turned off location services.</p><p><strong>3. Can I track someone else’s Oppo A1 5G  location without their permission?</strong></p><p>No, you cannot track someone else’s Oppo A1 5G  location without their permission. The Find My app only allows you to track the location of devices that are signed in with your Apple ID, and you need the other person’s permission to share their location with you.</p><p><strong>4. Can I prevent someone from tracking my location?</strong></p><p>Yes, you can take steps to prevent someone from tracking your phone’s location. Here are some measures you can consider:</p><ol><li>Turn off location services or GPS.</li><li>Adjust app permissions.</li><li>Use airplane mode.</li><li>Use a VPN or professional location changer tool like Dr.Fone - Virtual Location to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-gps-location-ios.html" >change your phone location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li><li>Check for spyware.</li><li>Turn off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.</li><li>Review privacy settings.</li><li>Be cautious with social media.</li><li>Use encrypted messaging.</li><li>Avoid public Wi-Fi.</li><li>Clear location history.</li></ol><p>Taking these precautions can help safeguard your phone’s location and enhance your privacy.

For all the right reasons, people wanted to stick to it to make sure that they catch the splendid Pokemon no matter where they are stationed. But the problems started when iSpoofer stopped working and there was no way anyone could continue to use or initiate iSpoofer update. When you open the application, you’d either see an error message, a subtle hint at an apology, or a pop-up that says that the app is under maintenance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/ispoofer-shut-down-pic-1.jpg"                      alt="ispoofer shut down pic"                ></p><p>All of them are the alternative ways of saying - ‘We are not available anymore’. But will iSpoofer be back in the year 2021? Can we expect to revive our Pokemon catching abilities with the iSpoofer update? Even if it comes back, will it be available for Android and iPhone users? If not - then do we have any other application that we can use for this purpose? To get answers to all these questions, you have to continue to read this space.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-update-iSpoofer"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-update-iSpoofer" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Can’t I update iSpoofer?"></a>Part 1: Why Can’t I update iSpoofer?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/ispoofer-not-able-to-log-in-pic-2.jpg"                      alt="ispoofer not able to log in pic"                ></p><p>To put it very simple and upfront - The reason why you are unable to update iSpoofer is that it has been shut down. You can no longer use the existing application on the phone or download it from their website. Initially, when the app was down, people thought it could have been a Pogo update that is causing the error. So, they uninstalled the app and tried to download it again from the official website of the iSpoofer app. To their disappointment, the error message showed up even then. It took a while for everyone to accept that the application was no longer available and their desperate attempts to get it to work went in vain.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Ispoofer-error-message-pic-3.jpg"                      alt="Ispoofer error message pic"                ></p><p>Undoubtedly, iSpoofer was a ‘game’ changer in the literal sense. You didn’t have to move from your place, you can catch some rare Pokemon and you get additional points for being the active wanderer. It’s of course a ‘cheat route’ to play the game and it has finally come to the notice of Niantic that a third-party app is being used to play the game.</p><p>Now that didn’t go down well with the makers. The whole essence of Pokemon Go is to ‘Go Out’ from the house to explore the presence of Pokemons in the surroundings. So, having a third-party application is going to change a lot of things. Pokemon blacklisted the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Ispoofer-account-suspension-pic-4.jpg"                      alt="Ispoofer account suspension pic"                ></p><p>The main target users for iSpoofer were the Pokemon Go players. With them gone, the revenue and usage of the app have reduced to a great extent and the creators have decided to pull the app out. And that is why you will no longer find a new version of iSpoofer that will be compatible with the game. The older version has anyway been blacklisted and won’t be of any use for the players and no iSpoofer update information so far</p><p>Even in 2021, there is no guarantee that the app will be back so it’s better to not keep the hopes up. The major business for the app could have been in 2020 when the world stayed home. However, if everyone was unable to download and update the app in the year 2020, there are very bleak chances of having it back in 2021.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Is-there-a-good-alternative-for-iSpoofer"><a href="#Part-2-Is-there-a-good-alternative-for-iSpoofer" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Is there a good alternative for iSpoofer?"></a>Part 2: Is there a good alternative for iSpoofer?</h2><p>There are quite a few ways to spoof your location in the Pokemon Go Game but then they narrow down to even smaller numbers when we start searching for the ‘reliable’ options. So, here are a few ways you can find a good alternative for iSpoofer.</p><p><strong>VPNs -</strong> There are certain VPNs that offer in-built location spoofing features that might come in handy for playing games like Pokemon Go. They change your location on the rest of the internet so it might be a little tricky for the makers to catch the foul play.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPNs-pic-5.jpg"                      alt="VPNs-pic-5"                ></p><p>Google Play Store Apps - There are certain applications you will find on Google Play Store or even the App store that offer ‘Fake GPS’ changes. You simply have to search for ‘Fake GPS Location Changers’ and you get some options. Find the one with the best rating and this can work for a while. However, there is no guarantee of when they’ll abandon you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Google-play-store-apps-pic-6.jpg"                      alt="Google-play-store-apps-pic-6"                ></p><p>The most reliable option that you can go for is using - Dr. Fone. It is Wondershare’s master app that changes your location on the world map, the very same will reflect on all your devices, social media accounts, and internet searches. It’s very hard to detect that you’ve used a spoofer. This is how to use it -</p><p><strong>Step 1 -</strong> You can use the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Dr.Fone Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>Spoofer for both Android and iPhones. So, starting off, you need to connect your OnePlus Nord N30 5G (the phone) to your system - be it a laptop or a computer. You will be prompted to accept the ‘Terms and Conditions and then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/drfone-change-location-pic-7.jpg"                      alt="drfone-change-location-pic-7"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2 -</strong> Once you are in, then the page will display a map and your location will be clearly mentioned. You need to go to the Teleport Mode you will find on the top right corner of the page. Enter your new location on the map.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Drfone-virtual-location-pic-8.jpg"                      alt="Drfone-virtual-location-pic-8"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3 -</strong> You can use the coordinates to get to the location or once the map displays, you can zoom in and move the pointer from one place to another and then click on ‘Move Here’ so that the location will be shifted from the previous one to new.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Drfone-virtual-location-pic-9.jpg"                      alt="Drfone-virtual-location-pic-9"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4 -</strong> Now it’s easier to launch Pokemon Go but give it a few minutes before your changed location is completely registered and keep the new location realistic.</p><p>As in, you can’t jump from Russia to America in 2 hours, can you?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-registered-pic-10.jpg"                      alt="change-location-registered-pic-10"                ></p><p>It’s quite easy to spoof your location for games like Pokemon Go using Dr. Fone and it will even stay undetected if you do it the right way. Also, the whole process to change the location hardly takes a few minutes, so you don’t have to spend time understanding how it all works.

Like other browsers, it also tracks your location and shares it with websites. Although Firefox asks for your permission before sharing your location, it can still be a privacy concern for many people. For many reasons, disabling your location is disadvantageous, so <strong>Firefox spoof location</strong> can resolve your concerns.</p><p>It is not hard to change or spoof your location in Mozilla Firefox. Stick with this article to learn different ways to <strong>fake a location in Firefox</strong> on devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-1.jpg"                      alt="firefox featured image"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Preparations-Before-Spoofing-Your-Location-in-Firefox"><a href="#Part-1-Preparations-Before-Spoofing-Your-Location-in-Firefox" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Preparations Before Spoofing Your Location in Firefox"></a>Part 1: Preparations Before Spoofing Your Location in Firefox</h2><p>Before starting with <strong>Firefox location spoof</strong>, you must be aware of how the platform and websites determine your location. There are many ways a browser can detect your location. It includes services like IP addresses, GPS tracking, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. The main tool browsers and websites use to determine your location is HTML5 Geolocation API.</p><h3 id="1-Basic-Understanding-of-the-HTML5-Geolocation-API"><a href="#1-Basic-Understanding-of-the-HTML5-Geolocation-API" class="headerlink" title="1. Basic Understanding of the HTML5 Geolocation API"></a>1. Basic Understanding of the HTML5 Geolocation API</h3><p>Basically, a browser API called HTML5 Geolocation API is used by websites and browsers to detect a user’s location using longitude and latitude coordinates. It is strictly based on user permissions for detecting location. That means you will receive a permission prompt whenever a website or browser uses it to detect your location. If you refuse the permission, they can’t use this API for location determination.</p><h3 id="2-How-Does-HTML5-Geolocation-Work"><a href="#2-How-Does-HTML5-Geolocation-Work" class="headerlink" title="2. How Does HTML5 Geolocation Work?"></a>2. How Does HTML5 Geolocation Work?</h3><p>HTML5 Geolocation determines your location using the longitude and latitude coordinates with the help of GPS. If your device doesn’t have GPS tracking, it uses Wi-Fi and cell tower signals to detect the OnePlus Nord N30 5G device’s location. The location detected by HTML5 Geolocation is highly accurate with accuracy up to street level. Due to its high precision in locating users, it can create privacy issues for users.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Computers"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Computers" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Computers"></a>Part 2: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Computers</h2><p>Many ways are available for you to fake or disable your desktop location in Mozilla Firefox to address your privacy concerns. You can either disable or change the location in the browser or use a third-party app or extension. Below, we have explained the three most common ways to fake or disable your location in Firefox.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Disable-Geolocation-in-Firefox"><a href="#Method-1-Disable-Geolocation-in-Firefox" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Disable Geolocation in Firefox"></a>Method 1: Disable Geolocation in Firefox</h3><p>If you want to stop websites from accessing your location from Mozilla Firefox, you can disable the geolocation feature using Firefox Settings. The process to disable your location in Mozilla Firefox is covered using these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open Mozilla Firefox on your computer to disable its location. Click the “Three Vertical Bars” icon to select “Settings.” Now, tap “Privacy &amp; Security” from the left sidebar and navigate to “Permissions.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-2.jpg"                      alt="access privacy and security"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click “Settings” in front of “Location” to manage the location settings. It will open a window with a list of all the websites that can access your location. Depending on your needs, you can choose between “Remove Web Site” or “Remove All Web Sites” to remove their location access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-3.jpg"                      alt="remove the specific or all websites"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> If you want to block the websites from accessing your location indefinitely, you can select the “Block new requests asking to access your location” option. Once selected, click “Save Changes” to disable your geolocation on Firefox.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-4.jpg"                      alt="enable the block new option"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Manually-Change-Your-Firefox-Location"><a href="#Method-2-Manually-Change-Your-Firefox-Location" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Manually Change Your Firefox Location"></a>Method 2: Manually Change Your Firefox Location</h3><p>Disabling your location on Mozilla Firefox can stop websites from accessing your location. It also means websites with location-based services will no longer work. That’s why it is better to <strong>spoof the location on Firefox</strong> rather than disabling it. Firefox allows you to manually change your location using its advanced settings. The steps required for this process are given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Once Mozilla Firefox is open, type “about:config” and press Enter. You will see a warning screen as you modify advanced settings. You have to click on the “Accept the Risk and Continue” button to proceed further.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-5.jpg"                      alt="hit the accept the risk button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> First search for “Geo.enabled,” and when it appears, toggle its value from “True” to “False” to disable geolocation. To spoof your location, search for “geo.provider.network.url” and press the “Pen” icon to edit it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-6.jpg"                      alt="tap on the edit button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You can enter your desired location using its latitude and longitude coordinates. The format to enter your location coordinates should be:</p><p><strong>“data:application&#x2F;json,{“location”: {“lat”: LATITUDE VALUE, “lng”: LONGITUDE VALUE}, “accuracy”: 27000.0}.”</strong></p><p>Once done, your geolocation will be changed to your desired location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-7.jpg"                      alt="add your fake firefox location"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Use-The-Location-Guard-Firefox-Extension"><a href="#Method-3-Use-The-Location-Guard-Firefox-Extension" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Use The Location Guard Firefox Extension"></a>Method 3: Use The Location Guard Firefox Extension</h3><p>Another way you can protect your location from websites is to use the “<a class="link"   href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/location-guard/" >Location Guard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“ add-on in Mozilla Firefox. It is generally recognized as an extension, also available in the Add-Ons Store of Firefox. The steps to add “Location Guard” and use it to alter your location are following:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Click on the “Three Vertical Bars” icon from the top left corner of your Firefox and select “Add-ons and themes.” Tap “Extensions” from the left sidebar and search for “Location Guard” in the Add-Ons Store. Once located, click “Add to Firefox” to add it to your browser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-8.jpg"                      alt="add the extension to firefox"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You can choose between two options to protect your location’s privacy. Using the “Privacy Levels” option, you can select a privacy level and location range to add noise when a website tries to locate you. It stops websites from detecting your accurate location, though they can still locate the general area.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-9.jpg"                      alt="set the privacy levels"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Using its “Fixed Location” feature from the left sidebar, you can change your location. Here, select any location from the map by placing the “Marker” on it to change your browser’s location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-10.jpg"                      alt="set the fixed location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Phones"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Phones" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Phones"></a>Part 3: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Phones</h2><p>It is not only on computers where you can use Firefox fake location but also on smartphones.

These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option.

That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-OnePlus-Nord-CE-3-5G-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-OnePlus-Nord-CE-3-5G-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone.

Well, in this case, you should consider using a route generator app. For instance, with a reliable GPX file generator, you can easily track a route offline. This can help you navigate your way without an active internet connection or even let you excel in games like Pokemon Go. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know about running route generator and Pokemon map generator apps in detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/best-route-generator-apps-1.jpg"                      alt="Route Generator App Banner"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-a-Route-Generator-App-And-Why-to-Use-it"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-a-Route-Generator-App-And-Why-to-Use-it" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is a Route Generator App (And Why to Use it)?"></a>Part 1: What is a Route Generator App (And Why to Use it)?</h2><p>In nutshell, a route generator app would help you navigate from one point on the map to another. Though, these apps have some add-one features compared to any run-of-the-mill navigation app. With the help of a GPX file generator feature, they can just export your mapped route offline. In this way, you can simply import the GPX file again (on the same or another map) and navigate your way without any active internet connection.</p><p>Therefore, it can help you navigate when you hike, trail, cycle, play games like Pokemon Go, and do other activities where there is low internet connectivity.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Best-Route-Generator-Apps-You-Should-Try"><a href="#Part-2-5-Best-Route-Generator-Apps-You-Should-Try" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try"></a>Part 2: 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try</h2><p>If you are also looking for a functioning GPX generator app for your device, then I would recommend the following options:</p><ol><li><strong>Route4Me</strong></li></ol><p>Route4Me is a dynamic GPS planner and route generator app that you can use for leading Android and iOS devices.

Solving the internet issues"></a>1. Solving the internet issues</h3><p>Many times, 3uTools is unable to load the map, or the map crashes. The reason for this is that 3uTools is unable to connect to the Google Maps API. This can also occur if your internet connection is unstable.</p><p>If this is the cause of your <strong>3uTools virtual location not working</strong>, there isn’t much you can do because this is a technical issue that can only be resolved by a technical expert. You might try relaunching 3uTools and repeating the spoofing procedure to refresh it. You may also try changing to “Mapbox” to see if it addresses the problem.</p><h3 id="2-Restarting-and-Closing-the-Software"><a href="#2-Restarting-and-Closing-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="2. Restarting and Closing the Software"></a>2. Restarting and Closing the Software</h3><p>When all of the aforementioned options fail, a decent option is to close the software and restart it after a few minutes. This is because the software frequently encounters an error, which is resolved when you close the software, making this a viable choice. We would also advise you to go to the Task Manager after closing the software and End Task it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-2.jpg"                      alt="restart the software"                ></p><h3 id="3-3uTools-reinstallation"><a href="#3-3uTools-reinstallation" class="headerlink" title="3. 3uTools reinstallation"></a>3. 3uTools reinstallation</h3><p>The most common cause of any software not working is poor installation. Some crucial files or components of the software are left behind as a result of faulty installation. As a result, reinstallation or the usage of a different location spoofing program is the only choice remaining.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-3.jpg"                      alt="reinstall 3utools"                ></p><h3 id="4-Restarting-Your-Computer"><a href="#4-Restarting-Your-Computer" class="headerlink" title="4. Restarting Your Computer"></a>4. Restarting Your Computer</h3><p>Restarting your computer is another easy option that many 3uTools users have found useful. If your virtual location feature stops working, simply close the app and restart your computer. This would delete the software from the Random access memory, as well as any bugs or errors that were preventing it from working.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-4.jpg"                      alt="restart computer"                ></p><h3 id="5-Verifying-the-network-connection-and-that-the-phone-is-unlocked"><a href="#5-Verifying-the-network-connection-and-that-the-phone-is-unlocked" class="headerlink" title="5. Verifying the network connection and that the phone is unlocked"></a>5. Verifying the network connection and that the phone is unlocked</h3><p>When you encounter a ‘not working’ problem when using the 3uTools software, the first thing you should do is check to ensure that your internet is operational and that there are no interruptions in your connections. You can resolve this by troubleshooting your internet and ensuring that its wire is correctly hooked in, as well as ensuring that your phone is already unlocked.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-5.jpg"                      alt="verify the netwrok connection"                ></p><h3 id="6-Checking-that-all-dependent-components-have-been-downloaded"><a href="#6-Checking-that-all-dependent-components-have-been-downloaded" class="headerlink" title="6. Checking that all dependent components have been downloaded"></a>6. Checking that all dependent components have been downloaded</h3><p>Another major reason why many individuals experience problems with the 3uTools program is a lack of necessary components. While dependent components are normally downloaded along with the software, this is not always the case. As a result, it is critical to check that you have downloaded all necessary components to ensure that the software works properly.</p><h3 id="7-Changing-the-Source-Map"><a href="#7-Changing-the-Source-Map" class="headerlink" title="7. Changing the Source Map"></a>7. Changing the Source Map</h3><p>Users frequently report that the map is not loaded. The maps on the 3uTools software fail to load as soon as users activate the virtual location option. You can attempt “Load embedded maps” to solve this issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-6.jpg"                      alt="load embedded maps"                ></p><p>Alternatively, change the source map between Google Maps and Open Street Maps.</p><h3 id="8-Uninstalling-iTunes-and-rebooting-your-system"><a href="#8-Uninstalling-iTunes-and-rebooting-your-system" class="headerlink" title="8.

Uninstalling iTunes and rebooting your system</h3><p>Many customers have reported encountering the “3uTools virtual location developer image load failed” problem, with the majority of them appearing to be iOS 17 users. 3uTools either does not load the location images or the screen becomes frozen.</p><p>Remove iTunes from your computer. Then, try restarting it. Install iTunes from the App Store once more. Restart your computer. After that, connect your iPhone to a PC and confirm that it is unlocked.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Best-3uTools-Virtual-Location-Alternative-Program-You-Can-Use-in-2024"><a href="#Part-3-Best-3uTools-Virtual-Location-Alternative-Program-You-Can-Use-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Best 3uTools Virtual Location Alternative Program You Can Use in 2024"></a>Part 3: Best 3uTools Virtual Location Alternative Program You Can Use in 2024</h2><p>Stop fretting if you frequently encounter the <strong>3uTools virtual location not working</strong> problem despite attempting various fixes.

Wonderful idea! Here’s how to use Dr.Fone Virtual Location spoofer Nokia C12 Pro app to simulate movement such as walking the streets and catching more Pokémon:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> In the Virtual Location interface, click the middle icon at the top right (which looks like inverted S) to symbolize movement simulation between two points.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Type your destination and click Go.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> A popup shows the distance of the place from your current location (spoofed).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png"                      alt="drfone virtual location two point simulation"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Dr.Fone Virtual Location allows you to choose the simulation speed – you can select walking, cycling and a four-wheeler to simulate those speeds. Click Move Here.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> In a new popup, choose if you want to route to repeat and select the number of times.

Open Pokémon Go and start catching!</p><p><strong>Simulating Movement Between Multiple Points</strong></p><p>Similarly, you can simulate between multiple points to play elaborate pranks on your friends and family. If you simply spoof your location to another point as shown previously, they might not believe it. But, if you show movement from one location to another, they can’t deny that, can they?

Please contact your cellular carrier and try again”. This message indicates that your phone is not connected to the internet.</p><p>As a result, your contacts, photos, and messages are not showing. Life360 may be using cellular data instead of Wi-Fi, but it’s not certain. To avoid this, let us read what we should know.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-is-Life360-Location-Wrong"><a href="#Part-1-Why-is-Life360-Location-Wrong" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why is Life360 Location Wrong?"></a>Part 1: Why is Life360 Location Wrong?</h2><h3 id="Interference-From-Nearby-Devices-Networks"><a href="#Interference-From-Nearby-Devices-Networks" class="headerlink" title="Interference From Nearby Devices&#x2F;Networks"></a>Interference From Nearby Devices&#x2F;Networks</h3><p>In some cases, Life360 may not be able to determine the location of your device because it is being interfered with by other nearby devices or networks. For example, if you have an iPhone or iPad, it may be using the same cell tower as your Nokia C12 Pro.</p><p>The Life360 app has to use the closest available cell tower to determine your location. So if another device uses the closest tower, Life360 will use that instead.</p><h3 id="Poor-Signal"><a href="#Poor-Signal" class="headerlink" title="Poor Signal"></a>Poor Signal</h3><p>A poor signal in a particular region, particularly if you’re commuting, is the most common cause of Life360’s incorrect location. When your phone is in a poor signal area, the app will use the internet instead of cellular data to determine the location of your contacts.</p><p>Therefore, it is important to keep an eye on the network lines to determine whether or not this is indeed the source of the problem that prevents your Life360 from being found.</p><p>To get more information about how often does life360 update location, read about the Life360: Learn How Everything Works!</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Fix-Life360-Shows-Wrong-Location-Issue"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Fix-Life360-Shows-Wrong-Location-Issue" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Fix Life360 Shows Wrong Location Issue?"></a>Part 2: How to Fix Life360 Shows Wrong Location Issue?</h2><p>There are several ways to fix the Life360app problems that life360 not updating its location.

If you notice that life360 is displaying the wrong location, you should examine your Internet connection settings to prevent life360 from displaying an inaccurate location.</p><p>Switch off the option that saves power and then turn on the wireless Internet connection.</p><p>You may turn off your smartphone’s power-saving mode by heading to the status bar and selecting the appropriate option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/how-to-fix-life360-shows-wrong-location_1.jpg"                      alt="review the internet settings"                ></p><p>Please note that this is just for Android users. Also, do not forget to consider that your Android smartphone’s settings may vary from those listed below.</p><p>The “switch off low power mode” option may be found in the “Settings”&gt; “Battery” menu on an iOS device.</p><p>Android users should also follow this procedure if life360 displays an incorrect location. For battery conservation, numerous programs are disabled when the low power state is engaged.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Double-check-Your-Current-Location-in-the-Settings"><a href="#Method-2-Double-check-Your-Current-Location-in-the-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Double-check Your Current Location in the Settings"></a>Method 2: Double-check Your Current Location in the Settings</h3><p>If life360 shows the incorrect location, the smartphone’s location services significantly come into play. The location settings must be activated to prevent the life360 location issue, and the current program must be updated accordingly.</p><p>Scrolling horizontally on the status bar on an Android device is all that is required for consumers to visit the website. Of course, you can also run the software in the background, which may be accomplished in a variety of straightforward but distinct ways based on the Nokia C12 Pro device’s model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/how-to-fix-life360-shows-wrong-location_2.jpg"                      alt="double-check your current location"                ></p><p>You may access the Background App Refresh function by going to the settings menu on your iOS device and selecting “Settings,” followed by “General,” and then selecting “Background App Refresh.” Next, launch the location services function by navigating to “Settings”&gt; “Privacy”&gt; “location services” and selecting “Location Services” from the drop-down menu.</p><p>After that, touch on the symbol that represents Life360, as shown below; this will take you to a screen where you may change “Allow Location Access” to “Always” and “Enable Precise Location.”</p><h3 id="Method-3-Connecting-One-Device-at-a-Time"><a href="#Method-3-Connecting-One-Device-at-a-Time" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Connecting One Device at a Time"></a>Method 3: Connecting One Device at a Time</h3><p>Only one device may be used to sign in to the Life 360 app at a time. To prevent the life360 false location problem, log out of all other devices and use just one. When many devices are logged into Life 360 simultaneously, the user’s location might be incorrectly determined.</p><p>If you want reliable results, you must be logged in from the same device. If you use numerous devices simultaneously to log in to Life360, it will report incorrect location errors for each one. Therefore, it is possible to get inaccurate data. Use a single device to log into life360 to prevent the issue of a wrong location showing up.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Keep-Your-Location-on-Life360-in-One-Place"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Keep-Your-Location-on-Life360-in-One-Place" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Keep Your Location on Life360 in One Place?"></a>Part 3: How to Keep Your Location on Life360 in One Place?</h2><p>Two of the most important and easy ways to keep your location on life360 in one place are:</p><h3 id="1-Stopping-both-Wi-Fi-and-Cellular-Data-Transmissions"><a href="#1-Stopping-both-Wi-Fi-and-Cellular-Data-Transmissions" class="headerlink" title="1.

In addition to the fact that you’re unable to use the internet, people in your circle will notice something wrong. In addition, it may not be adequate to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/how-to-fix-life360-shows-wrong-location_3.jpg"                      alt="stopping both wi-fi and cellular data transmissions"                ></p><p>Those with an iPhone have the advantage of being able to disable the usage of cellular data directly inside the application’s settings. However, those with an Android device will need to resort to other approaches.</p><p>iPhone users may access the Cellular setting by going to the Settings app and tapping on it. This will switch off the cellular data for the Life360 app. Turn off Life360 by swiping the switch to the off position mentioned above. Life360 will not be able to provide an accurate location report for you so long as there is no Wi-Fi access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/how-to-fix-life360-shows-wrong-location_4.jpg"                      alt="stopping both wi-fi and cellular data transmissions"                ></p><p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p><ul><li>You can use only one device to connect to the internet.</li><li>No need to manually switch between apps.</li><li>You can easily manage all your data.</li></ul><p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p><ul><li>You cannot use other devices at the same time.</li><li>If you lose the connection, you need to reconnect.</li></ul><h3 id="2-Faking-Your-Location"><a href="#2-Faking-Your-Location" class="headerlink" title="2.
